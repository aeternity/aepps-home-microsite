<p class="question">Which problem is your æpp solving?</p>
<p class="answer">
Decentralized curation of whitelists (e.g. businesses on Yelp for a given city, advertisers in an ad network, trusted data providers in a data market)
</p>
<p class="question">What was your approach?</p>
<p class="answer">I started by implementing the important features of a TCR as described in the paper in a single smart contract, used dapp-scratch to generate handlers for the ABI, then wrote a quick interface in vue.js to demonstrate the features.</p>
