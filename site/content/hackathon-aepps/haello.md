<p class="question">Which problem is your Ã¦pp solving?</p>
<p class="answer">
People looking for company can actively and trustfully offer spending drinks, food or entry for a night club.
</p>
<p class="question">What was your approach?</p>
<p class="answer">To give users a little extra motivation to get in contact with the person who is willing to share something, they get a little reward upfront just for getting in touch (via chat or instant messaging...later). The big spender can decide at a certain point (maybe directly or after a brief conversation) if he wants to spend his budget on the candidate. </p>
