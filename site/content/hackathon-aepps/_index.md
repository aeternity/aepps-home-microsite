Firstly we thank all the Hackathon participants for contributing and and congratulate the winners!

The three submissions with the most "I Agree" votes, had another 24 hours to optimise their aepps. After these 24 hours, our jury picked the 1st, 2nd and 3rd place. The winner received 5000 AE, the runner up 2000 AE and the third place 1000 AE.

In our [Mediumpost](https://blog.aeternity.com/hæckathon-winners-976fe831d5e7) you can get to know our jury, how they rated all the aepps and picked the winners.

We thank everyone who contributed and are looking forward to the next hackathon!
