Firstly we thank all the Hackathon participants for contributing and submitting your aepps! All aepps can now be voted for until **13 December 2017 18:00 CET**.

The three submissions with the most "I Agree" votes ("Disagrees" won't be counted), will have another 24 hours to optimise their aepps. After these 24 hours, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd place will be picked by our jury. The winner will receive 5000 AE, the runner up 2000 AE and the third place 1000 AE.

**For testing:** all aepps are deployed and available on the Kovan Network, so switch to Kovan if you're using MetaMask. The Identity Manager runs with Kovan by default.

**For voting:** the Voting Aepp is available on the Main Ethereum Network.
