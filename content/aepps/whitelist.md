## Which problem is your Ã¦pp solving?

Decentralized curation of whitelists (e.g. businesses on Yelp for a given city, advertisers in an ad net, trusted data providers in a data market)

## What was your approach?

I started by implementing the important features of a TCR as described in the paper in a single smart contract, used dapp-scratch to generate handlers for the ABI, then wrote a quick interface in vue.js to demonstrate the features.
