## What it is
The Messages æpp offers you secure messaging and is seamlessly integrated to ensure clearer communication between users. Allowing for more agility during communication with regard to seamless transfers, future iterations of this app will facilitate instant transfers between specific contacts by tapping the transfer icon from within a contact. It will also foster meaningful contact between members of the ecosystem by allowing them to share a proof from the Proof æpp and share posts from the Wall æpp, enhancing communication between block partners and community members.
