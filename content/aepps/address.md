## What it is
Our Address Book allows users to save addresses and display them as individual contacts. By providing integrated access and "short cuts" including pre-filled contact info to other core apps such as transfer and our messenger app, users are able to quickly perform contact/aepp-specific actions with ease. The Address Book allows you to access and customize your contacts while using other aepps to facilitate smooth connection within the ecosystem.
