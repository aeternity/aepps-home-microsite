## What it is
Our Addresses æpp allows users to save addresses and display them as individual contacts. By providing integrated access and "short cuts" including pre-filled contact info to other core apps such as transfer and our Messages æpp, users are able to quickly perform contact- or æpp-specific actions with ease. The Addresses æpp allows you to access and customize your contacts while using other aepps to facilitate smooth connection within the ecosystem.
