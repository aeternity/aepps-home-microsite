## What it is
The Answers for AE æpp brings together several interesting aspects of our current culture; celebrity worship, Twitter short form communication and philanthropy. Users are encouraged to create compelling questions directed toward well know people in the social media sphere. Once the person or group creates a video answer, all support bids from these questions are then donated to them.

## How it works
A user asks a famous person a question on Twitter, supporting their question with AE tokens. Based on other users interest in the question being answered, the community can add value to the question by supporting it with additional tokens. The person or group is then notified both on Twitter and through private message that the game is on! The person or group then has 1 month to create a video answer to the question being asked of them and post it on Twitter. They are encouraged to like and retweet this post to create buzz within their community in an effort to raise the value of the donation.
Once the person or group has answered the question, all proceeds from the AE token support is then awarded to the them. This creates the opportunity for the community to put their tokens where their questions are and donate to a great cause.

## The future
This gateway æpp will hopefully serve as a bridge between the blockchain world and mere mortals who don’t yet understand how it works. By eliciting the PR machine of modern celebrity and making important donations to worthwhile causes, we hope to promote wider adoption of the power and potential that æternity holds for its users and the world.
